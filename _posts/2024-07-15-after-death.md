What if there is nothing after death? When you die, you die and everything ends. End of Story.

Death is the only thing that is guaranteed in one’s life. The greatest minds have always tried to find out what is beyond death. The most common theory that has been around is that a life is the combination of body and soul. Body dies but soul doesn’t. And after the death, one’s soul goes either to heaven or hell. But its only a theory. Nobody knows that. And those who know have known cannot tell was what the world after death is like. What an irony.

So what if death is total ending of one’s life? What if there is no soul? What if the thing that everyone calls the soul is just the consciousness felt by the brain, which also dies when the body dies? What if the belief that the soul of good person goes to heaven and that of bad person goes to hell is just a belied since there is no soul at all? In that case, the existence of heaven and hell will be of no sense. The reunion of the loved ones in afterlife will be a silly theory. All the prayers done, all the rituals performed and all the gifts in the name of the dead ones will be in vain. And to think that all these concepts rests on a single theory i.e. the existence of soul. If a life has soul, then there may exists heaven and hell. All our prayers, rituals and gifts will have some meaning and reunion with the loved ones in the afterlife may be possible. But this is the thing that we may only know when we die.

Or we may never know.
